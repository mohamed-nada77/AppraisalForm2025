AppraisalPortal
AppraisalPortal is a .NET 8 Razor Pages application that streamlines end-to-end employee performance appraisals. It replaces scattered spreadsheets and email threads with a clear, role-based workflow and consistent scoring, plus PDF outputs for official records.
üí° What it solves
‚Ä¢	Consistency: Everyone follows the same forms, scales, and weights (no more custom Excel formulas).
‚Ä¢	Clarity: Employees, managers, HR, and the CEO each get purpose-built pages with the exact actions they need.
‚Ä¢	Speed: Automated roll-ups, scoring, approvals, and one-click PDF export.
‚Ä¢	Auditability: Every submitted form has an immutable PDF and a summary report.

‚Ä¢	Soft skills: numeric (1‚Äì10), normalized to a soft-skills subtotal.
‚Ä¢	Final score: Final = KPI * 0.70 + SoftSkills * 0.30.
You can adjust weights in ScoringService if your company uses a different model.
